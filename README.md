> Important Note: This features requires your permission for the current website to open popups

## Installation
Since I did not put this onto the Firefox Addons Hub, you can download the xpi [here](https://github.com/drblaui/Firefox-Link-to-QR-Code/releases/). Firefox should try to automatically install the extension upon download


## Todo
- Style
- Link Clicking actually doesn't work
